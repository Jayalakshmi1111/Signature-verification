# Signature-verification

Signature verification using Siamese network:

A Siamese Network consists of twin networks which accept distinct inputs but are joined by an energy function at the top. This function computes a metric between the highest level feature representation on each side. The parameters between the twin networks are tied.Hereby I have build the model using Siamese network and done some hyperparameter tuning to predict the best accuracy
